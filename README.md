# Depict
What is it?
A website where users can make random drawings and see others' creations.

## Running locally
To run this project locally, you will need:
1. NodeJS & NPM
2. Netlify 
3. SupabaseJS

Command to install packages:
`npm install`

Command to run the website locally:
`netlify dev`
## Technologies used
1. HTML
  - The mark-up language used to structure content
3. Adobe Xd
  - The tool I used to make wireframes for the website
4. Visual Studio Code
  - VS Code is the code editor I wrote HTML, SASS, JS, and the Readme file in. Plugins such as live server helped speed up the development process for me.
5. Git & Github
  - Git is a version control system and Github is where I hosted the files for the website. I used Git Bash in VS Code to add, commit and push files to this Github repository, which was quite convenient.
6. jQuery
  - For easier manipulation of the DOM
7. Supabase
  - Supabase is an open-source alternative to Google's firebase. It uses an SQL database and Netlify's Gotrue library for authentication.
8. Netlify
  - Netlify is a platform for hosting static websites, and I have found it to be wayyy faster than Github pages. Additionally, they provide serverless functions, similar to AWS Lambda. I used the serverless functions to communicate with the database and API, without exposing secrets.
9. PaperJS
  - The library used to draw on the canvas
